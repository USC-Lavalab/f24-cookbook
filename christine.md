# Pho Recipe :P

## broth

2 pounds beef bones (preferably leg or knuckle bones)
1 pound beef brisket
1 large onion (halved)
1 large piece of ginger (about 3-4 inches, halved)
4-5 star anise
3-4 cloves
2 cinnamon sticks
1 tablespoon coriander seeds
1 tablespoon fennel seeds
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1 tablespoon sugar
Salt to taste
6-8 cups water
For the Soup:
8 ounces rice noodles (banh pho)
½ pound beef sirloin or eye of round, thinly sliced
Fresh herbs: cilantro, Thai basil, and mint
Bean sprouts
1 lime (cut into wedges)
1-2 Thai chilies (sliced thin)
Thinly sliced onion
Hoisin sauce and Sriracha (optional for serving)

## instructions

1. Prepare the Broth:
   Roast the bones: Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C). Place the beef bones on a baking sheet and roast for about 30 minutes until browned.
   Char the ginger and onion: While roasting the bones, char the onion and ginger by placing them on an open flame (stove or grill) until blackened, or roast them in the oven for about 10 minutes.
   Toast the spices: In a dry pan, lightly toast the star anise, cloves, cinnamon, coriander, and fennel until fragrant (about 2 minutes).

2. Cook the Broth:
   In a large stockpot, add the roasted bones, brisket, charred ginger, and onion.
   Add the toasted spices and enough water to cover everything (about 6-8 cups).
   Bring the broth to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.
   Simmer for 4-6 hours, skimming any impurities that rise to the surface.
   After simmering, remove the brisket and set aside. Strain the broth to remove the bones, spices, ginger, and onion. Add fish sauce, sugar, and salt to taste.

3. Prepare the Noodles:
   Soak the rice noodles in warm water for about 20 minutes, then cook according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.

4. Assemble the Pho:

Thinly slice the brisket you cooked in the broth.
Place a portion of cooked rice noodles in each bowl.
Top with slices of brisket and raw beef (the hot broth will cook the raw slices).
Pour the hot broth over the noodles and beef.

5. Garnish and Serve:
   Garnish with fresh herbs, bean sprouts, thinly sliced onion, and Thai chilies.
   Serve with lime wedges, hoisin sauce, and Sriracha on the side.

## enjoy :D
