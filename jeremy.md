# Mexican Menudo

## Ingredients

- 2 lbs beef tripe, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1 lb beef feet (optional, adds richness)
- 2 tbsp salt
- 1 tbsp black pepper
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 1 tbsp oregano
- 1 tbsp ground cumin
- 2 bay leaves
- 10 cups water
- 5 guajillo chiles, deseeded and soaked
- 5 ancho chiles, deseeded and soaked
- 1 tbsp chili powder
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 2 limes, cut into wedges (for serving)
- Chopped cilantro, onion, and dried oregano (for garnish)

## Instructions

1. In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add the beef tripe and beef feet. Season with salt and black pepper.

2. Let the meat simmer for about an hour, skimming off any foam that forms on top. Add minced garlic, chopped onion, oregano, cumin, and bay leaves for flavor.

3. Meanwhile, prepare the chili sauce by blending the soaked guajillo and ancho chiles along with chili powder and a bit of the soaking water until smooth. Strain the sauce to remove any solids.

4. In a separate pan, heat vegetable oil over medium heat and pour in the strained chili sauce. Simmer for about 10 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.

5. Once the tripe and feet are tender (after about 2 hours of simmering), add the chili sauce to the pot and stir to combine. Let everything simmer together for another 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.

6. Serve the menudo hot with lime wedges, and garnish with chopped cilantro, onion, and a sprinkle of dried oregano for added flavor.

Enjoy your traditional Mexican menudo, best served with warm tortillas or bolillo bread!
