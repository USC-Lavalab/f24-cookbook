- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 cups beef broth
- 1 cup chicken broth
- Salt and pepper (to taste)
- 2 cups fresh cheese curds

## Instructions

1. Prepare the Potatoes: Wash and cut potatoes into thick fries. Soak them in cold water for 30 minutes, then drain and pat dry.

2. First Fry: Heat oil in a deep fryer to 325째F (160째C). Fry potatoes in batches for 5 minutes until soft but not browned. Remove and drain on paper towels.

3. Make the Gravy: In a saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour to create a roux and cook for 2 minutes. Gradually add beef broth while stirring. Add Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. Simmer until thickened.

4. Second Fry: Increase oil temperature to 375째F (190째C). Fry the potatoes again for 2-3 minutes until golden and crispy. Drain and season with salt.

5. Assemble the Poutine: Place hot fries on a plate. Top with cheese curds evenly over the fries.

6. Add Gravy: Pour hot gravy over the cheese and fries, allowing the cheese to melt slightly.

7. Serve Immediately: Enjoy your homemade poutine while it's hot and the cheese is melty.

8. Optional Toppings: Add extras like chopped chives, bacon bits, or pulled pork if desired.
