## Enchiladas de Mole

# Ingredients

**A lot of these ingredients just need to be eyeballed tbh**

- About 4 tablespoons of Mole Negro
- 2 pieces (letters) of Chocolate Abuelita
- About 1 tablespoon of Chicken Bouillon
- Water
- Corn Tortillas
- Oil
- Queso Fresco
- Sour Cream
- Rotisserie Chicken
- Avocado

# Instructions

1. Make the sauce: Take a 20 oz blender and fill it with mole, Chocolate Abuelita, and Chicken Bouillon. Fill the blender with water until full and blend it.
2. Take a big pot (ideally should be bigger than the tortilla) and pour the sauce inside, bringing it to a boil. Stir continuously.
3. Once the sauce boils, bring it down to low heat while occasionally stirring.
4. While the sauce is boiling, oil a pan, heat it up and fry the tortillas until golden.
5. Use tongs to completely cover the tortilla in the sauce.
6. Put the sauce covered tortilla on a plate and fill it with warm chicken.
7. Roll up the tortilla and top it with sour cream, queso fresco, and avocado.
8. Repeat with as many tortillas as your heart desires.
9. Enjoy with a side of red rice and lettuce!
